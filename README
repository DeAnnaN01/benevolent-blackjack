This package uses Python's distutils.

To run Benevolent Blackjack on your system, you also need to install the
PeafowlTerm library, which Benevolent Blackjack uses for displaying terminal
colors.  Get it from:
 * http://www.qnan.org/~pmw/software/peafowlterm

The documentation for Benevolent Blackjack is in several places:
- the doc/ directory
- the manpage;
- the source code is reasonably well commented.

To run the program without installing it through distutils, run
bbj.py in the package's root directory.
